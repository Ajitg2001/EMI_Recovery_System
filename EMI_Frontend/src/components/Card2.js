    cardText: "The overhead of staffing and running costs would be greatly reduced upon retaining an efficient third-party collection agency. To maintain an in-house collection, some businesses spend big money on staffing, telephone calls, invoicing, visits to the debtorâ€™s office etc. Third-party agencies do not require such investment.",

    cardText: "The harsh economic climate in a majority of jurisdictions has made it trickier to recover debts. In such situation, orthodox methods that fail to yield positive results.

    cardText: "With the increase in international trade and investment, the risk and cost of going across borders to recover the debt may be more than the debt itself. In such case, in-house debt recovery might not be able to recover the amount. In such a case, retaining the services of a debt recovery agency within the jurisdiction of the debtor will help the business recover the debt.",

  {
    cardTitle: "6. Third-party agency can offer expert help",
    cardText: "Also, the process of recovery of some debts may be technical. Hiring a debt recovery expert skilled in the technical process of debt recovery can promptly solve this problem without having to deal with training your in-house debt collection stuff.",
